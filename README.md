# Postmates Delivery Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of PostMates deliveries I made between 3/9/2019 and 3/21/2020 in Denver, CO. This project features _data cleaning_, _data wrangling_, _descriptive statistics_, and _visualizations_. The goal was to explore my delivery data to enhance efficiency and earnings.
